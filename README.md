# Python Potrace
Pure Python Port of Potrace. This is a python port of Peter Selinger's Potrace (based on 1.16 code).

This port is needed because many python hooks to the original code such as `pypotrace` have installation issues and compilation problems with some OSes. This potrace is written in pure python and will be compatible with basically anything.

# Installing

To install or use as a requirement:
* `pip install potracer`

### Potrace-CLI
If you wish to use the Command Line Interface that is stored in a sister project `potrace-cli` (https://github.com/tatarize/potrace-cli). This can be installed with:
* `pip install potracer[cli]`

or:

* `pip install potrace-cli`

The cli project contains valid console script entrypoints for potrace. If you install the command-line package it will add `potracer` to your console scripts. Note the `-r` suffix so that it does not interfere with potrace that may be otherwise installed.

### Numba (optional, experimental)
[numba](https://github.com/numba/numba), an open source jit compiler for python & numpy, has been shown to speed up python potrace considerably (for complex images approx. a factor of 2).
While numba supports most [platforms](https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/latest/user/installing.html#compatibility), it does not support _every_ platform that can run python.
Depending on your requirements for runtime and depending on your platform, it might be worth to try.

__By default, numba is disabled.__ Potrace with numba enabled can be installed with:

* `pip install potracer[numba]`

to make use of the speedup.

# Requirements
* numpy: for bitmap structures.

# Speed
Being written in python this code may be about 500x slower than the pure-c potrace. It is however fast enough for general use.

# How To Use

This is a barebones script that uses `potracer` to convert a given file to an svg. The file loading is performed with `Pillow`. The file saving is done iterating over the curves inside the plist to produce the SVG with the corners and curves of the potrace structures.

Note: The `bm.trace()` is the primary function call needed for potrace.
```python
import sys
from PIL import Image
from potrace import Bitmap, POTRACE_TURNPOLICY_MINORITY  # `potracer` library


def file_to_svg(filename: str):
    try:

        image = Image.open(filename)
    except IOError:
        print("Image (%s) could not be loaded." % filename)
        return
    bm = Bitmap(image, blacklevel=0.5)
    # bm.invert()
    plist = bm.trace(
        turdsize=2,
        turnpolicy=POTRACE_TURNPOLICY_MINORITY,
        alphamax=1,
        opticurve=False,
        opttolerance=0.2,
    )
    with open(f"{filename}.svg", "w") as fp:
        fp.write(
            f'''<svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" width="{image.width}" height="{image.height}" viewBox="0 0 {image.width} {image.height}">''')
        parts = []
        for curve in plist:
            fs = curve.start_point
            parts.append(f"M{fs.x},{fs.y}")
            for segment in curve.segments:
                if segment.is_corner:
                    a = segment.c
                    b = segment.end_point
                    parts.append(f"L{a.x},{a.y}L{b.x},{b.y}")
                else:
                    a = segment.c1
                    b = segment.c2
                    c = segment.end_point
                    parts.append(f"C{a.x},{a.y} {b.x},{b.y} {c.x},{c.y}")
            parts.append("z")
        fp.write(f'<path stroke="none" fill="black" fill-rule="evenodd" d="{"".join(parts)}"/>')
        fp.write("</svg>")


if __name__ == '__main__':
    file_to_svg(sys.argv[1])
```

# Parallel Projects
This project intentionally duplicates a considerable amount of the API of `pypotrace` such that this library can be used as a drop-in replacement.

To permit performing potrace commands from the commandline, this library offers CLI potrace as an optional package.
